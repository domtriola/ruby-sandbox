### A programmatic proof of one of my favorite riddles
#
# Ten gnomes are captured by an evil wizard.
#
# The gnomes know that tomorrow they will be lined up in a single file line,
# all facing the same direction so that each gnome only sees the gnomes
# in front of him or her. Then each gnome will have a red or white hat
# placed on their head. Starting with the gnome in back each gnome will
# get one chance to guess the color of his/her own hat. If that gnome is right
# he/she lives. Otherwise he/she dies.
#
# The night before the execution the gnomes devise a plan to guarantee the
# survival of at least 9 of themselves.
#
# What is there plan?
